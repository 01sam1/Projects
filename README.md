## 🚀 Potential Improvements
- Implement multithreading using the threading module for faster data retrieval.

- Add functionality to accept a file containing a list of seat numbers for batch processing.

- Enhance robustness to skip invalid seat numbers without terminating the program.

- Improve error handling by applying structured try-except blocks.
